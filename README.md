Do It Yourself GLSL Live Wallpaper For Android

The app consists of two part :

- A gallery / browser for glsl.heroku.com
- A live wallpaper that loads a shader saved in sd ext

The gallery view can be used to preview the shader before selecting and saving its code to the SD.
The live wallpaper part has some settings allowing to trade quality for performance.

This is an initial version written as a first GDX / Open GL App. Expect instability.
